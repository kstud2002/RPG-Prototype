Top-Down RPG-Prototype in Powershell

To start the Script just open it in Windows Powershell and make sure it is in the same folder as "Screen1.txt".

The playing field is stored in "Screen1.txt" and can be edited as you wish.

The default color- / character-code is:
```
Water: '~' (blue)
Grass: '.' (green)
Tree (trunk): '|' (brown)
Tree (leaves): '0' (darkgreen)
Bridge: '"' (magenta)
```
